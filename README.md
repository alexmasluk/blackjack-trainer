Blackjack Trainer
=================

It's well know that Blackjack offers more advantageous odds for the player than other casino games. Maximizing the player's odds involves knowing when to make the appropriate move:
*Hit
*Stay
*Double Down
*Split
*Insure
*Surrender

There are two factors that determine which move is most statistically advantageous. They are **the value of the dealt cards** and **the house rules**. One may consult numerous tables which recommend a move after considering these various factors. For example, from bestonlinecasino.com:

These values change slightly depending on the house rules:
*Is the dealer required to **hit** or **stay** on a soft 17?
*Can the player double down after a split?
*Does the casino allow early surrender?
*How many decks comprise the shoe? 

Memorizing all these tables seems like an obnoxious proposition, so why not code them into an app and learn by actually playing the game? This seemed like a straightforward way to learn the rudiments of Android app development. 

What it does so far:
*Play Blackjack against the house with a 4-deck shoe
*Hit, stay, or double down
*Win and lose virtual money
*Optionally display the value of each hand 
*Optionally allow dealer to hit on soft 17

What it will do:
*Allow player to split, surrender, and insure
*Track statistics of player's win rate vs the house over time
*Optionally recommend the optimal move / indicate when player chose the suboptimal move
*Optionally adjust bet size, player starting funds, shoe deck count
*Optionally allow double after split and early surrender
*Function with the device in landscape orientation ;)

Here are a few screengrabs of the app in action.
